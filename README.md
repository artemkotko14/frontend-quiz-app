## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- Vite
- SASS

### What I learned

Sliding animation of a switch:

```css
input:checked + .slider::before {
  transform: translateX(20px);
}
```

```css
.theme-toggle-wrapper:focus-within {
  border: 2px solid purple;
}
```

That means: if any child inside .theme-toggle-wrapper has focus, the wrapper gets styled.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to practise making React apps using TypeScript.
